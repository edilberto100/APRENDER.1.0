===============================================================================
Instructions for Building and running APPHi-field:
===============================================================================

1.- Compile-script
APPHi folder has a Compile-script, to run this script you must have installed
the cfitsio and hdf5 library. You can compile de Compile-script script with

./Compile-script

The Compile-script generates the APPHi_field program.

2.- To run APPHi_field program, you need four txt files (Bias.txt, Darks.txt,
flats.txt and field.txt). Each txt files must have the path of each fits file
(see the examples files on the steep 2). APPHi has six into parameter (Bias,
Darks, flats, field, umbrall and number of curves for the noise signal in
this order).

Bias, Darks, flats and field files are the list of each fits files.
Umbrall is the parameter of light on the field (this value must be between 0 and 1).
This parameter help the APPHi in the binarization to find the stars. The higher be
the umbrall, the fewer stars we will find. Default Value of this umbrall is 0.25. And
the final parameter describes the number of lightcurve used for the noise signal.

You can run the example for APPHi_field program on the APPHI-field folder with
./Test-script
